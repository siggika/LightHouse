LightHouse
IR Reader/Blaster for Android

Author: Sigurður Karlsson

This is a little pet project of mine, not sure it will
work at all, but why not?

The goal is to develop app for Android phones that have
built in IR-Blaster and a light sensor present.
So they can read IR-code with the built-in light sensor,
then convert to IR-code and be able to send the IR-code.

I just want to be able to use the built-in IR-Blaster of
my Samsung Galaxy S4 without any external devices.
Will focus on developing for the S4 to begin with and
take it from there.
